OscCtl
sinusoidal component for an anti-aliasing oscillator.  

first inlet
-phasor input

second inlet
-frequency

first, both phasor and frequency are multiplied by their harmonic
number.  an offset is added to the phasor input based on pi/2.
after reading a cos-lookup table, the sinusoid is multiplied by its
assigned amplitude.  then it's attenuated by another cos-lookup
table to prevent aliasing.

this is done by comparing the frequency to the nyquist frequency.  
we create a ratio of 0-1 and use it to lookup quadrant 3 (pi - 3pi/2),
add one, and then multiply that to smoothly 'turn off' the oscillator.

finally, we send the sinusoid's amplitude to out of the patch. if the 
harmonic is even, we turn it off.  eventually we'll add the total 
amplitudes together and use that total to keep the oscillator's 
amplitude between (-1, 0, 1).

LOADBANG
-determine amplitude of an even or odd harmonic (0-even, 1-odd)
-get the ratio of one over nyquist (1/(samplerate*0.5))
-get the offset of the sinusoid (harmonic number * 0.25 - 0.25)
